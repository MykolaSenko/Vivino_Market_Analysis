# The code `st.write("# Welcome to Vivino! ðŸ‘‹")` is used to display a heading on the webpage that says

    The Vivino Market Analysis Project is aimed at analyzing the wine market based on data gathered by Vivino. 
    The section of the project presented on this webpage focuses on identifying wines that are associated 
    with keywords such as coffee, toast, green apple, cream, and citrus. Subsequently, the top 10 of these 
    wines are analyzed. The project also displays wine prices by year and examines the correlations among 
    them. This entire process is facilitated using Streamlit.

    You can access the project's repository [here](https://github.com/MykolaSenko/Vivino_Market_Analysis).

    The project was carried out by a team of three Junior Data Scientists from [BeCode](https://becode.org) between August 20 and 31, 2023.
