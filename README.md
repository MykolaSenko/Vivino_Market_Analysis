# Vivino_Market_Analysis
A group project @ [BeCode.org](https://becode.org/) as part of the **AI Bootcamp** in Gent.
## Project description
Learning project to consolidate SQL knowledge

The project used an SQL database with a large amount of data from [Vivino](https://www.vivino.com/BE/en/) to consolidate the knowledge in SQL, specifically in:

JOIN operations
GROUP BY operations
AGGREGATIONS operations (average, sums, ...)
SELECT operations
LIMIT operations
Other operations
The following tasks were performed:

Highlight 10 wines to increase sales. Which ones should we choose and why?
Which country should we prioritize and why?
Highlight the best wineries. Which wineries should we choose and why?
Find all the wines that have the keywords "coffee", "toast", "green apple", "cream", and "citrus".
Find the average wine rating for each country.
Show the average wine rating for each country.
Analyze the correlation between the age of wine and its price.

## Installation

2. Change directory to the root of the repository
3. Install required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

## Usage

To run the Streamlit app, use the `streamlit run` command in the command line. The syntax is:

**streamlit run main_page.py**

where `main_page.py` is the name of the Python script that contains your Streamlit app. You need to run this command from the root folder of your project.

To navigate to other materials in the folder, you can use the cd command. For example, to navigate to the pages folder, you would run the following command:

**cd pages**

Once you are in the desired folder, you can see the files and folders in the terminal.
